        "main_content": "After extensive hands-on testing with OpenAI's Codex, I've found it to be a powerful but notably constrained tool for software development. The system operates as a chat-first experience, requiring GitHub integration and working within a sandboxed environment that limits certain capabilities.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Success rate ranges from 40-60% for maintenance tasks\n- Excellent for small updates and routine fixes\n- Struggles with complex multi-turn tasks\n- No network connectivity in sandbox (major limitation)\n\nThe Good:\n- Intuitive chat interface\n- Strong understanding of existing codebases\n- Helpful for documentation and explanation\n- Good at identifying potential bugs\n\nThe Limitations:\n- Sandbox restrictions\n- Error handling issues\n- Multi-turn conversation challenges\n- Setup complexity\n\nBest Use Cases:\n1. Code maintenance\n2. Small updates\n3. Understanding legacy code\n4. Basic bug fixes\n\nNot Recommended For:\n1. Complex architectural changes\n2. Network-dependent operations\n3. Multi-step refactoring\n4. Production deployments\n\nConclusion:\nCodex shows promise as a specialized tool for code maintenance and understanding, but its current limitations prevent it from being a comprehensive development solution. It's best viewed as an assistant for specific tasks rather than a replacement for traditional development workflows.",

Codebase understanding\n2. Maintenance tasks\n3. Code review assistance\n4. Documentation generation\n\nLimitations:\n1. Greenfield development\n2. Complex architectural decisions\n3. Business logic understanding\n4. Cross-service integration\n\nMarket Position:\nCodex occupies a unique position as a senior developer tool rather than a general-purpose coding assistant.
